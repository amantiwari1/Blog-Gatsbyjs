## What is Kubernetes?
**Kubernetes**Â is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

## Why Multi-Nodes
**Why Multi-Nodes?**Â Because it is much faster and available than Single Node for Production to end-user, that's why we are going to setup multi-nodes.

## Requirements
** Before that**, you must start to download minikube for k8s and Vmbox and Redhat image, setup add and install RedHat or Centos OS to vmbox named Main. Let's start open vmbox and start the Main OS.


## Setup
Let's install net-tools for IP address and vim for editor CLI

```bash
yum install net-tools vim iproute-tc -y
```
## Docker Required
**Kubernetes** require in docker package so create file named docker.repo in 3 Nodes and start edit

```bash
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo
```

Make sure edit it below for download and install docker file to your pc

```bash
[docker]
baseurl=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/
gpgcheck=0
```

To install docker ce for free and enable and start always running in docker

```bash
yum install docker-ce -y --nobest
sytemctl start docker
sytemctl enable docker
```

## Installation K8s
lets install k8s

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-\$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
exclude=kubelet kubeadm kubectl
EOF

# Set SELinux in permissive mode (effectively disabling it)
sudo setenforce 0
sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config

sudo yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes
```


## Setup Multi-Nodes
Make Sure Clone Main to add more two nodes named node1 and node2 in vmbox and must regenerate different networks in different images. we need to add a name in host instead of IP address

Main in vm

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname main
exec bash
```

node1 in vm

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname node1
exec bash
```

node2 in vm

```bash
hostnamectl set-hostname node2
exec bash
```

set up Local DNS Name server

```bash
vim /etc/hosts
```

edit in hosts like this

```bash
192.168.43.35  main
192.168.43.151 node1
192.168.43.156 node2
```

same thing in node1 and node2 VM's

It is easier to transfer to another machine node1 in VM's

```bash
scp /etc/hosts 192.168.43.151:/etc/hosts
```

node2 in VM's

```bash
scp /etc/hosts 192.168.43.156:/etc/hosts
```

Now, Create kubeadm ( main )

```bash
kubeadm init --pod-networks=10.10.1.0/16
```

add config in main os

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

now join node1 and node2 to main

```bash
kubeadm join 192.168.43.35:6443 --token 1z41ua.pd2l2pl5df286hcb     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:4547a1aacde3bd0b1ff37fe27619aa858081634717b212e609dfeba96e0402be
```
